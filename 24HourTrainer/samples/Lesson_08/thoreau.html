<h2>On Living</h2>
<p>Every man is the builder of a temple called his body.</p>
<p>Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.</p>

<h2>On Books</h2>

<p>Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the  fit inheritance of generations and nations. </p>
<p>Books are to be distinguished by the grandeur of  their topics even more than by the manner in which they are treated.</p>
<p>Books can only reveal us to ourselves, and as often  as they do us this service we lay them aside. </p>
<h2>On Government</h2>
<p>I heartily accept the motto, "That government is best which governs least"; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.</p>
<p>Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a  just man is also a prison.</p>
<p>Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The  obedient must be slaves. </p>
<p>How does it become a man to behave towards the  American government today? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be  associated with it. </p>
